# Week8-project#
I did this file on its own to expand throughout the week.

Started the assignment, and got carried away until late at night, so hopefully I actually answered the questions....

should have done all on one, and then organized, made it twice as hard


turning it in.  I had to go the farm this morning to get Jen's car to start, was unable to finish the last of it, I will do it before tonight's homework.
